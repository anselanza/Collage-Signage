# Collage-Signage
*Processing sketch that creates collage-style words from a library of letter images*

This was created in a hurry (an hour or so) to get a sign for our "Street Choir" interactive sound installation at a launch event. Feel free to customise for your own purposes.

It allows you to load any number of images for each letter in your "alphabet" (whichever characters you require) and these get randomly picked to form the words you want. It makes an animated collage.
